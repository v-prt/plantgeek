### ðŸ’¡ About

PlantGeek is a fully realized live website, brought to life from concept to implementation by me ([@v-prt](https://github.com/v-prt)), with a significant contribution from my husband ([@j-prt](https://github.com/j-prt)), who adeptly set it up for self-hosting on our Raspberry Pi. The application showcases a frontend built with React and styled-components, and a backend orchestrated using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB through Mongoose.

The website delivers a seamless experience across devices, ensuring responsiveness whether you're on mobile, tablet, or desktop, with a beautiful user interface. Interaction with forms is enhanced through Formik and Yup for validation, providing immediate and helpful feedback. Data synchronization is gracefully managed with React Query.
